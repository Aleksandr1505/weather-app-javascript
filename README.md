# weather-app-javascript
Simple weather app, created by using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and [Weatherstack API](https://weatherstack.com/).
To work with API, you need to get an API key by registering on the site and insert it as `API_KEY` variable property in index.js file.
For example:
  Your API key is `16422fub7e3d8741f145bd52cfff322b`;
  In index.js file `const API_KEY = "16422fub7e3d8741f145bd52cfff322b"`.

In order to run the project, use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
